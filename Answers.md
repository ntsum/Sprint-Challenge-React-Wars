1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?
React JS is a user interface component library. It makes the process of creating the user interface portion of an application easier. It uses a virtual dom which then updates the browsers actual dom. It renders components into functional programs. 
2.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?
To think in react is to take something large and to break it down into smaller components. If you try to create Instagram by tackling the entire thing at once, it would be impossible. By looking at each component and what each component is meant to do, simplifies the programming process in React. 

3.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.
Functional component does not have a state.
Class component uses a state which can have information passed into it through props. 
1.  Describe state.
The state is a mutable object that lies in a component. It is assigned in the class constuctor and then with super();   Each component within a program can have a state. We can pass down information into the state to make different parts of our program behave the way we want it to. The state can then be changed using the setState() method. 
1.  Describe props.
Props are property that can be passed from parent to child elements. Props are immutable and are used to display data on the user interface.
